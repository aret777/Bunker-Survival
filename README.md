# Bunker-Survival - its a postapocalyptic survival game, where you need to select people with different qualities (job, fears, items they bring, etc...) and survive with them during the game.

You need to manage resoruces, find food, weapons, explore the world and achieve final goals in order to win the game. However, after one apocalypse, there is going to be another. I am planning to do different scenarios - Fallout, global flood, asteroid impact, zombie-apocalypse, back in time to Dinosaurs...
